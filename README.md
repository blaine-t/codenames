<hr />

We will create a simple, accessible web application version of Codenames for 4+ players that delivers all the fun, fast-paced party aspects that made Codenames successful while allowing users the freedom to play how they want.

## Technologies Used

- Node - We decided on Node to run our application. While we wanted to explore Deno it's hard not to stick with what works

  - Next.js â€“ Used for our full stack approach. Powered by React
    - React - Our frontend javascript framework that we ended up going with

- Supabase - We ended up going with Supabase for our database as it has great integration with Next.js and allows us to have an easy auth flow

## Demo Video - WIP

## Account / Lobby

For R1 we wanted to have a working account and lobby.

## Game

For R1 we didn't want to prioritize having a functional game over working account and lobby functionality so we decided to make a dummy version with just styling that is available to view at https://codenames.traudt.dev/protected/game.
